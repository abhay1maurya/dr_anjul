                        <ul>
                            <li>Homeopathic medicines are generally not prescribed in written form due to the potential for misuse or unsupervised repetition of medicines. Homeopathy requires a tailored approach, and the same disease may require different medicines over time. Likewise, the same medicine may be applicable to different conditions based on the underlying causes. To prevent incorrect usage, we dispatch medicines directly rather than issuing prescriptions.</li>
                            <li>In rare cases where medicine delivery is not possible, emergency prescriptions may be provided. This remains at the sole discretion of Dr. Anjul and his team.</li>
